## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL (or Railway database)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-rebooker.git
cd flight-rebooker
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

In `/server/.env`:

```env

## üß† Learning Goals

This project was created to:
- Learn full-stack development with PostgreSQL
- Practice RESTful API design
- Gain experience deploying apps to production
- Build a polished, resume-ready software project

---

## Project Scope & Limitations

This project represents a **functional MVP+** version of a flight rebooking system.  
It currently uses **simulated flight data stored in PostgreSQL**, with no real-time or third-party flight integration.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Connect to a real flights API**  
  This would enable real-time flight status, cancellations, and route availability, thus making the app usable by real users.

- **Implement user authentication**  
  While users are currently tracked anonymously via `localStorage`, future versions could support full account login, persistent sessions, and profile management.
